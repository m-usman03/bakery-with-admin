Bakery Website Boilerplate

Welcome to the Bakery Website GitHub repository! This project serves as a boilerplate for a bakery website with essential features implemented and placeholders for future enhancements. The project demonstrates basic CRUD functionality for products and includes static elements that can be extended to create a fully working application.

Features

Admin Panel:

Products Management:

Add, edit, delete, and view products.

Toppings List:

View a static list of available toppings.

Orders Table:

View a list of orders.

Customer Side:

Product Display:

Dynamically displays products from the admin's product CRUD.

Static Features:

The cart, contact us, and order placement are currently static pages for demonstration purposes.

This boilerplate can be extended to include fully functional features like cart management, order placement, and a dynamic "Contact Us" page.
